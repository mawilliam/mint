This application is meant to provide a simple way to track finances and set budgets. The project is motivated by two main goals:

* Keep all data local
* Be unaware of any banking credentials

As such, this application is meant to provide a modern mechanism to "balance a checkbook", follow a budget, and set financial goals. We believe it is important to enter transactions manually to take ownership of your money and be responsible for clearing each transaction.
